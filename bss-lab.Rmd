# Introduction

This tutorial requires `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("MSnbase")` and 
`r BiocStyle::Biocexptpkg("msdata")` package. 

```{r env, message = FALSE}
library("MSnbase")
library("msdata")
```

A longer version of the material is available
[here](https://rawgit.com/lgatto/bioc-ms-prot/master/lab.html).


# Data files in mass spectrometry

Most community-driven formats described in the table are supported in
`R`. We will see how to read and access these data in the following
sections.

```{r datatab, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
datatab <-
    data.frame(Type = c("raw", "identification", "quantitation",
                   "peak lists", "quant and id", "protein db"),
               Format = c("mzML, mzXML, netCDF, mzData",
                   "mzIdentML", "mzQuantML", "mgf", "mzTab", "fasta"),
               Package = c(
                   "*[MSnbase](http://bioconductor.org/packages/MSnbase)* (read and write in version >= 2.3.13) via *[mzR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/mzR)*",
                   paste("*[mzID](http://bioconductor.org/packages/mzID)* (read) and",
                         "*[MSnbase](http://bioconductor.org/packages/MSnbase)* (read, via *[mzR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/mzR)*)"),
                   "",
                   "*[MSnbase](http://bioconductor.org/packages/MSnbase)* (read)",
                   "*[MSnbase](http://bioconductor.org/packages/MSnbase)* (read)",
                   "*[Biostrings](http://bioconductor.org/packages/Biostrings)*"))

knitr::kable(datatab)
```

# Loading raw data

Raw data files (in any of the above formats) is read into R using
`MSnbase::readMSData` function that will return an list-like object of
class `MSnExp`.

```{r data1}
basename(fl3 <- msdata::proteomics(full.name = TRUE, pattern = "MS3TMT11"))
(rw3 <- readMSData(fl3, mode = "onDisk"))
```

An `MSnExp` object contains 

- the raw data (spectra), accessible with `[`
- features data, accessible as a dataframe with `fData`

We can also access specific data using

- `msLevel(rw3)`
- `rtime(rw3)`
- `precursorMz(rw3)`
- `centroided(rw3)`
- ...

```{r ex1}
table(msLevel(rw3), centroided(rw3))
```

# Loading identification data

```{r id}
basename(idf <- msdata::ident(full.name = TRUE))
iddf <- readMzIdData(idf)
```

```{r fdrplot}
library("ggplot2")
ggplot(iddf, aes(x = MS.GF.RawScore, colour = isDecoy)) +
    geom_density()
```

# Combining raw and identification data

```{r addid}
basename(quantFile <- dir(system.file(package = "MSnbase", dir = "extdata"),
                 full.name = TRUE, pattern = "mzXML$"))
basename(identFile <- dir(system.file(package = "MSnbase", dir = "extdata"),
                          full.name = TRUE, pattern = "dummyiTRAQ.mzid"))
     
msexp <- readMSData(quantFile)
fvarLabels(msexp)
msexp <- addIdentificationData(msexp, identFile)
fvarLabels(msexp)
```

# Quantitative data

Quantiative data is stored a objects of class `MSnSet`, which can be 

```{r msnset, fig.cap = "The MSnSet structure", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("./Figures/msnset.png")
```

1. Created from an `MSnExp` object with the `quantify` function.
2. Created from a spreadsheet produced by a third party software using
   the `readMSnSet2` function.

Before reading the spreadsheet, we need to identify which columns
contain quantitation data (that will be put into the `exprs` slot)
and the feature data (that will be put into the `fData` slot).

**Download** the data
[here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lgatto/bioc-ms-prot/master/data/cptac_peptides.txt).

```{r read}
f <- "./data/cptac_peptides.txt"
getEcols(f, split = "\t")
e <- grepEcols(f, "Intensity ", split = "\t") ## careful at the space!
(cptac <- readMSnSet2(f, ecol = e,
                      fnames = "Sequence",
                      sep = "\t"))
```

We can access the expression data with `exprs` and the feature
meta-data with `fData`.

For the sake of simplicity, we can clean up the feature variables and
only keep those of interest. It is possible to do this interactively
with

```{r selectfeats0, eval = FALSE}
cptac <- selectFeatureData(cptac)
```

or by setting the feature variables of interest.

```{r selectfeats}
cptac <- selectFeatureData(cptac,
                           fcol = c("Proteins",
                                    "Potential.contaminant",
                                    "Reverse",
                                    "Sequence"))
```

Let's also add sample annotations:

```{r pdata}
cptac$group <- rep(c("6A", "6B"), each = 3)
cptac$sample <- rep(7:9, 2)
sampleNames(cptac) <- sub("Intensity.", "", sampleNames(cptac))
pData(cptac)
```

# Data processing

## Filtering out contaminants 

```{r conts}
table(sel_conts <- fData(cptac)$Potential.contaminant != "+")
```

```{r rev}
table(sel_rev <- fData(cptac)$Reverse != "+")
```

```{r filtering}
(cptac <- cptac[sel_conts & sel_rev, ])
```

Note how the filtering has been recorded in the object's processing
log.

## Notes on missing values

Unfortunately, some software uses 0 irrespecitve whether the data has
intensity zero and when the data haven't been observer. Below we fix
this.


```{r setna}
exprs(cptac)[exprs(cptac) == 0] <- NA
table(is.na(exprs(cptac)))
```

From here on, one could **filter** data with missing values, which however
sacrifices a lot of data.

```{r filterNA}
(cptac <- filterNA(cptac))
```

Perform **imputation**, considering the underlying nature of missingness,
i.e missing not at random (left-censored) or at random.

![Root-mean-square error (RMSE) observations standard deviation ratio (RSR), KNN and MinDet imputation. Lower (blue) is better.](./Figures/imp-sim.png)

See Lazar *et al.* [Accounting for the Multiple Natures of Missing
Values in Label-Free Quantitative Proteomics Data Sets to Compare
Imputation
Strategies](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.5b00981).

The best solution is arguably to handle missing values at **the
statistical test level** (see later).

## Log transformation

```{r log}
(cptac <- log(cptac, base = 2))
```

## Normalisation

Normalisation is handled by the `normalise` (or `normalize`) function.

```{r norm}
(cptac <- normalise(cptac, method = "quantiles"))
```

## Summarisation

So far we have quantitation values at the peptide level, while the
level of interest are proteins. We can take all peptides that are
associated to a protein (or protein group), as defined by the
`Proteins` feature variable and aggregate them using a preferred
operation.

```{r featsfig, fig.cap = "Aggregation between different levels.", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Features/articles/Features_files/figure-html/featuresplot-1.png")
```


```{r featsfig2, fig.cap = "Examples of aggregations.", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://rformassspectrometry.github.io/Features/articles/Features_files/figure-html/plotstat-1.png")
```


```{r combine}
(cptac <- combineFeatures(cptac, fcol = "Proteins", method = "mean"))
```

**As you will see in the next section, there are much better aggregation
function than the mean!**

# Session info {.unnumbered}

```{r sessionInfo, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
