From a 2011 study that compared the expression profiles of 3 cell
lines using RNA-Seq, MS-based proteomics and immunofluorescence
(protein-specific antibodies).

They observed an overall Spearman correlation of 0.63.

**In what ways to these summaries differ?**

Using a common gene-centric identifier, but

- What do we have along the rows, what are our features? Transcripts
  on the left. Protein groups on the right.
- How are these intensities produced?

## Take-home message 1

These data tables are less similar than they appear.

## 2. How does mass spectrometry work?

### (applies to proteomics and metabolomics)


---
class: middle

### Overview

![](./Figures/overview1.jpg)

---
### How does MS work?

1. Digestion of proteins into peptides - as will become clear later,
   the features we measure in shotgun (or bottom-up) *proteomics* are
   peptides, **not** proteins.

--

2. On-line liquid chromatography (LC-MS)

--

3. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a technology that **separates** charged
   molecules (ions, peptides) based on their mass to charge ratio
   (M/Z).

---
### Chromatography

MS is generally coupled to chromatography (liquid LC, but can also be
gas-based GC). The time an analytes takes to elute from the
chromatography column is the **retention time**.

![A chromatogram, illustrating the total amount of analytes over the retention time.](./Figures/chromatogram.png)

???

- This is an acquisition. There can be one per sample (with muliple
  fractions), of samples can be combined/multiplexed and acquired
  together.

---
class: middle

An mass spectrometer is composed of three components:

1. The *source*, that ionises the molecules: examples are Matrix-assisted
   laser desorption/ionisation (MALDI) or electrospray ionisation
   (ESI).
2. The *analyser*, that separates the ions: Time of flight (TOF) or Orbitrap.
3. The *detector* that quantifies the ions.

Ions typically go through that cylce at least twice (MS2, tandem MS,
or MSMS). Before the second cycle, individual *precursor* ions a
selected and broken into *fragment* ions.

### Identification: database

![Uniprot human proteome](./Figures/uniprot1.png)

???

## [Human proteome](https://www.uniprot.org/help/human_proteome)

In 2008, a draft of the complete human proteome was released from
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot: the approximately 20,000 putative human
protein-coding genes were represented by one UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
entry, tagged with the keyword 'Complete proteome' and later linked to
proteome identifier UP000005640. This UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot H. sapiens
proteome (manually reviewed) can be considered as complete in the
sense that it contains one representative (**canonical**) sequence for
each currently known human gene. Close to 40% of these 20,000 entries
contain manually annotated alternative isoforms representing over
22,000 additional sequences


## [What is the canonical sequence?](https://www.uniprot.org/help/canonical_and_isoforms)

To reduce redundancy, the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot policy is to describe
all the protein products encoded by one gene in a given species in a
single entry. We choose for each entry a canonical sequence based on
at least one of the following criteria:

1. It is the most prevalent.
2. It is the most similar to orthologous sequences found in other species.
3. By virtue of its length or amino acid composition, it allows the
   clearest description of domains, isoforms, polymorphisms,
   post-translational modifications, etc.
4. In the absence of any information, we choose the longest sequence.


## Are all isoforms described in one UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry?

Whenever possible, all the protein products encoded by one gene in a
given species are described in a single UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry,
including isoforms generated by alternative splicing, alternative
promoter usage, and alternative translation initiation (*). However,
some alternative splicing isoforms derived from the same gene share
only a few exons, if any at all, the same for some 'trans-splicing'
events. In these cases, the divergence is obviously too important to
merge all protein sequences into a single entry and the isoforms have
to be described in separate 'external' entries.

Rates: Two Sides of the Same Coin](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/pr700739d).

???


- (global) FDR = B/(A+B)
- (local) fdr = PEP = b/(a+b)


---
###  Identification: Protein inference

- Keep only reliable peptides
- From these peptides, infer proteins
- If proteins can't be resolved due to shared peptides, merge them
  into **protein groups** of indistinguishable or non-differentiable
  proteins.

## 4. Quantitative proteomics data processing and analysis

You will be use the*[MSnbase](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.9/MSnbase)* and *[MSqRob](https://github.com/statOmics/MSqRob)* packages during the lab.

Quantitative proteomics data processing 

- data processing/cleaning
- **missing values**
- log transformation and normalisation
- **summarisation**

class: middle 

### Missing values

Can appear because

- the feature is missing (due to biology, i.e not at random) 
- the feature was missed during the acquisition process (i.e at
  random) 
- mixture thereof 

What can one do?

- filter out features (or at least those that have *too many* missing values).
- imputation
- when possible, use a statistical method that accounts for missing
  values (for example
  [proDA](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/661496v1),
  [MSqRob](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/668863v1), ...)

---
class: middle 

### Missing values

Can appear because

- the feature is missing (due to biology, i.e not at random) - for example `impute(, method = "min")`
- the feature was missed during the acquisition process (i.e at
  random) - for example `impute(, method = "MLE")`
- mixture thereof - for example `impute(, method = "mixed")` (used in *[DEP](https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.9/DEP)*)
  
What can one do?

- filter out features (or at least those that have *too many* missing values).
- imputation (`MSnbase::impute` - see above and next slide)
- Feature rescuing (identification transfer, matching between runs)
- when possible, use a statistical method that accounts for missing
  values (for example
  [proDA](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/661496v1),
