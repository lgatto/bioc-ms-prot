# Mass spectrometry and proteomics using R/Bioconductor

## Table of content

- Brief intro on how MS works
- Raw MS data (linked to the how MS works section)
- MS quantitation: MS1 vs MS2, label-free vs labelled
- Peptide identification and protein inference
- Proteomics data processing overview
- Some packages of interest
